                Fifth-generation computers are most commonly defined as those that are based on artifi
                cial intelligence, allowing them to think, reason, and learn .<BR> 
                Some aspects of fifth-generation computers—such as voice and touch input and speech 
                recognition—are being used today. In the future, fifth-generation computers are expected 
                to be constructed differently than they are today, such as in the form of optical computers 
                that process data using light instead of electrons, tiny computers that utilize nanotechnol
                ogy, or as entire general-purpose computers built into desks, home appliances, and other 
                everyday devices.<BR>Basically, fifth generation of computer systems is based on ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) and nano technology </p>

            Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. Such machines may be called AIs.
