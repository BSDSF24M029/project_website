The replacement of the transistor with integrated circuits (ICs) marked the beginning of 
the third generation of computers. Integrated circuits incorporate many transistors and 
electronic circuits on a single tiny silicon chip, allowing third-generation computers to be 
even smaller and more reliable than computers in the earlier computer generations. Instead 
of punch cards and paper printouts, keyboards and monitors were introduced for input and 
output; hard drives were typically used for storage. An example of a widely used third
generation computer is shown in the figure.<br>THIRD-GENERATION COMPUTERS
Third-generation computers used integrated
circuits, which allowed the introduction of
smaller computers such as the IBM System/
360 mainframe shown here.</p>

            An integrated circuit (IC), also known as a microchip or simply chip, is a small electronic device made up of multiple interconnected electronic components such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors.<br> These components are etched onto a small piece of semiconductor material, usually silicon. Integrated circuits are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones, and televisions, to perform various functions such as processing and storing information. They have greatly impacted the field of electronics by enabling device miniaturization and enhanced functionality.</p>
