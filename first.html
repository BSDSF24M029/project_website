                The first computers were enormous, often taking up entire rooms. They were powered 
                by thousands of vacuum tubes—glass tubes that look similar to large light bulbs—which 
                needed replacing constantly, required a great deal of electricity, and generated a lot of heat. 
                First-generation computers could solve only one problem at a time because they needed to 
                be physically rewired with cables to be reprogrammed , which typically took 
                several days (sometimes even weeks) to complete and several more days to check before
                the computer could be used. Usually paper 
                punch cards and paper tape were used for 
                input, and output was printed on paper. 
                Two of the most significant examples 
                of first-generation computers were ENIAC 
                and UNIVAC. ENIAC, 
                was the world’s first large-scale, general
                purpose computer.<BR> Although it was not com
                pleted until 1946, ENIAC was developed 
                during World War II to compute artillery
                firing tables for the U.S. Army. Instead of 
                the 40 hours required for a person to com
                pute the optimal settings for a single weapon 
                under a single set of conditions using man
                ual calculations, ENIAC could complete the 
                same calculations in less than two minutes. 
                UNIVAC, released in 1951, was initially 
                built for the U.S. Census Bureau and was 
                used to analyze votes in the 1952 U.S. pres
                idential election.<BR> Interestingly, its correct 
                prediction of an Eisenhower victory only 
                45 minutes after the polls closed was not 
                publicly aired because the results were not 
                trusted. However, UNIVAC became the first 
                computer to be mass produced for general 
                commercial use. </p>

              <P>FIRST-GENERATION COMPUTERS
                First-generation computers,<br> such as ENIAC
                shown here, were large and bulky, used
                vacuum tubes, and had to be physically wired
                and reset to run programs.</P>

            A vacuum-tube computer, now termed a first-generation computer, is a computer that uses vacuum tubes for logic circuitry. While the history of mechanical aids to computation goes back centuries, if not millennia, the history of vacuum tube computers is confined to the middle of the 20th century. Lee De Forest invented the triode in 1906. The first example of using vacuum tubes for computation, the Atanasoff–Berry computer, was demonstrated in 1939. Vacuum-tube computers were initially one-of-a-kind designs, but commercial models were introduced in the 1950s and sold in volumes ranging from single digits to thousands of units. By the early 1960s vacuum tube computers were obsolete, superseded by second-generation transistorized computers.
