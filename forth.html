                A technological breakthrough in the early 1970s made it possible to place an increas
                ing number of transistors on a single chip. This led to the invention of the micropro
                cessor in 1971, which ushered in the fourth generation of computers. In essence, a 
                microprocessor contains the core processing capabilities of an entire computer on one 
                single chip. The original IBM PC  and Apple Macintosh computers, 
                and most of today’s traditional computers, fall into this category. Fourth-generation 
                computers typically use a keyboard and mouse for input, a monitor and printer for 
                output, and hard drives, flash memory media, and optical discs for storage. This gen
                eration also witnessed the development of computer networks, wireless technologies, 
                and the Internet. </p>

            A microprocessor is a computer processor for which the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[1] The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock-driven, register-based, digital integrated circuit that accepts binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic, and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary number system.
