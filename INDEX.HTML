Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.<br>A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems, including simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. Computers are at the core of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of computers and users.<br>there are different<b> computer consist of </b>two sort of parts that : </p>

                    The basic ideas of computing and calculating 
                    are very old, going back thousands of years. 
                    However, the computer in the form in which it is 
                    recognized today is a fairly recent invention.<br> In 
                    fact, personal computers have only been around 
                    since the late 1970s. The history of computers 
                    is often referred to in terms of generations, with 
                    each new generation characterized by a major 
                    technological development.<b> Precomputers and Early Computers (before approximately 1946)</b> 
                    Based on archeological finds, such as notched bones, knotted twine, and hieroglyph
                    ics, experts have concluded that ancient civilizations had the ability to count and com
                    pute. The abacus is considered by many to be the earliest recorded calculating device; 
                    it was used primarily as an aid for basic arithmetic calculations. Other early computing 
                    devices include the slide rule, the mechanical calculator, and Dr. Herman Hollerith’s 
                    Punch Card Tabulating Machine and Sorter. This latter device (see Figure 1-7) was the 
                    first electromechanical machine that could read punch cards—special cards with holes 
                    punched in them to represent data. Hollerith’s machine was used to process the 1890 U.S. 
                    Census data and it was able to complete the task in two and one half years, instead of 
                    the decade it usually took to process the data manually. Consequently, this is considered 
                    to be the first successful case of an information processing system replacing a paper
                    and-pen-based system. Hollerith’s company eventually became International Business 
                    Machines (IBM).The next sections 
                    summarize some early calculating devices and 
                    the different computer generations.</P>
