                (approximately 1958–1963) </i></b>
                 
The second generation of computers began 
when the transistor—a small device made 
of semiconductor material that acts like 
a switch to open or close electronic cir
cuits—started to replace the vacuum tube.<br> 
Transistors allowed second-generation 
computers to be smaller, less expensive, 
more powerful, more energy-efficient, and 
more reliable than first-generation com
puters. Typically, programs and data were 
input on punch cards and magnetic tape, 
output was on punch cards and paper print
outs, and magnetic tape  
was used for storage. Hard drives and pro
gramming languages (such  as FORTRAN 
and COBOL) were developed and imple
mented during this generation.<br> Second-generation computers, such as
the IBM 1401 mainframe shown here,
used transistors instead of vacuum
tubes so they were smaller, faster,
and more reliable than st-generation
computers.<br><b><i>key takeaways:</i></b>second generation of computers was based on transistors and at that time it was a huge improvement in coputers to use transistors rather than vaccum tubes</p>

            A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics. It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more in miniature form are found embedded in integrated circuits. Because transistors are the key active components in practically all modern electronics, many people consider them one of the 20th century's greatest inventions
